# R'iscall's GShade Preset Emporium

If you're looking at this you probably follow my FFXIV photo antics. All of those screenshots use presets that I have made myself, and I'm going to use this place to share some of them!

## About these presets
I will do my best to make these work out of the box, but you are very heavily encouraged to modify them yourself! I'm still learning a lot about how this works and these presets are made to be messed around with! For every preset I release I'll also include a matching text file that can be used to learn how it works. It goes into detail on what each shader does and why it's in there, and you can use this information to either change things up or to use them in your own presets!

[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RiscallXIV) if you want to follow my WoL's adventures! I'm always messing with new stuff and put new shots up pretty regularly. I don't know how often I'll update this but I'll do what I can!
